    <b>Directions:</b>

    <ol>
      <li><p>Gather all your ingredients.</p></li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Cook sausage, ground beef, onion, and garlic in a Dutch oven over
          medium heat until well browned.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, tomato paste, and water.
          Season with sugar, 2 tablespoons parsley, basil, 1 teaspoon salt,
          Italian seasoning, fennel seeds, and pepper. Simmer, covered, for
          about 1 ½ hours, stirring occasionally.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna
          noodles in boiling water for 8 to 10 minutes. Drain noodles, and rinse
          with cold water.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg, remaining 2
          tablespoons parsley, and 1/2 teaspoon salt.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li><p>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</p></li>
      <li>
        <p>
          To assemble, spread 1 ½ cups of meat sauce in the bottom of a
          9x13-inch baking dish. Arrange 6 noodles lengthwise over meat sauce,
          overlapping slightly. Spread with 1/2 of the ricotta cheese mixture.
          Top with 1/3 of the mozzarella cheese slices. Spoon 1 ½ cups meat
          sauce over mozzarella, and sprinkle with 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Repeat layers, and top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese.
          Cover with foil: to prevent sticking, either spray foil with cooking
          spray or make sure the foil does not touch the cheese.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and bake
          for an additional 25 minutes.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li><p>Rest lasagna for 15 minutes before serving.</p></li>
    </ol>
